               <b>What Is Aqarabia?</b>
               <br/>
           
We are a real estate search engine that helps you find homes and property for sale or rent and provides real estate information at the local level to help you make better decisions in the process.<br/><br/>
We aim to be a delightfully smart partner when you are looking to buy, sell or rent a home or property. The smart part should help you find your dream home (or at least the dream home within your budget) and equip you with data and information about local real estate (without too much work). The delightful part should make you smile and keep you coming back.<br/><br/>
Whether you are moving down the street or clear across the country, we&#39;re here to help you understand real estate trends at the local level. When you are about to make the biggest financial decision of your life, we help you understand how your future home stacks up compared to similar homes on the market, and similar homes that have recently sold or rented. We show you how sales prices have been trending where it matters - in your country, city, and neighborhood.<br/><br/>
We&#39;re data enthusiasts but we don&#39;t expect you to be. Our crack team of engineers and analysts are focused on building tools - like our Amenities Maps and Real Estate Guides - to help you understand and interpret the real estate information. Real estate search just got much smarter.<br/><br/>

                
<b>What We Aren&#39;t</b>
<br/>  
We <b>ARE NOT</b> brokers or agents. We are not looking to make a commission on your real estate transaction. We will not sell your personal information. We will not force you to become a lead.
 <br/><br/>               
       
  
<b>How We Make Money</b>
<br/>  
We make money through advertising, not lead generation. Here&#39;s the story: real estate professionals and organizations currently spend around $4 billion every year on their marketing. Our business model is pretty simple - we create the best real estate search experience on the Web; you, your family and friends use us; real estate professionals and service providers advertise on our site; we continue to innovate to create an even better real estate search experience. Does that sound good to you?
 <br/><br/>     
                
<b>What We Believe</b>
<br/>  
<ul>
<li>Looking for a home shouldn&#39;t be an arduous experience</li>
<li>Information should be made freely and easily available to everyone</li>
<li>Most home buyers/sellers will work with a real estate professional for guidance</li>
<li>Great ideas come from user feedback</li>
</ul>
