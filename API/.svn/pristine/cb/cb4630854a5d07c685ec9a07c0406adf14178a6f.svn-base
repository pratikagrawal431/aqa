<b>Mortgage Information Services</b>. These terms apply specifically to the Services offered by Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc.:
 <b>Mortgages</b>. Aqarabia, specifically Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc., allows consumers to provide anonymous information to banks, lenders, financial institutions, originators, loan brokers, other mortgage professionals and their employees (collectively, the "Lenders") to request quotes on terms for home loans. Lenders may elect to respond to consumer requests with non-binding customized quotes of the terms they would offer to a borrower fitting the consumer's anonymous profile, as well as their contact information. These non-binding quotes are not intended to be official Loan Estimates as defined in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. Aqarabia, through Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc., also allows consumers to provide certain information to Lenders and receive Lender contact information or request that Lenders pre-approve them for home loans. Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. does NOT take mortgage applications. Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. does NOT make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans. Any loan inquiry you submit is NOT an application for credit. Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. does not pre-approve borrowers for loans. Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. lists Lenders who may conduct a preliminary review to determine your loan qualifications based on their guidelines. To receive a pre-approval letter, you must complete a short online questionnaire that asks for personal information including income, credit score, and monthly debt. After completing the questionnaire, you may see an estimated pre-approval amount based on the information you provided. To continue the process of requesting a pre-approval letter, a Lender will require more details, such as pulling your credit report (at your request). If you meet the Lender's guidelines based on preliminary review of your responses to the questionnaire and your credit report, you may receive an online pre-approval letter. A pre-approval letter is not an offer to lend, a commitment to make a loan, or a guarantee of specific rates or terms. Even if you receive a pre-approval letter, you may not get a loan from a Lender or a loan at a specific rate or subject to particular terms. A Lender may require income and asset verification, as well as satisfaction of other conditions, before they commit to extending a loan.

Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. does not guarantee that the loan terms or rates offered and made available by Lenders are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. When consumers submit the required information for a Lender to contact them or when consumers request pre-approval from a participating Lender, Lenders may elect to respond based on parameters established by the Lender and Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. will create a contact for the selected Lender based on parameters established by the Lender. If you, as a consumer, choose to contact a Lender through the Services offered by Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. by filling out a contact request or other request form or by completing a questionnaire on websites associated with these Services, you authorize Aqarabia Mortgages, Inc. to provide your name, contact information and other information you provide to a Lender, along with your quote or pre-approval request (if any). You acknowledge that, by submitting your contact request, other request form or by completing a questionnaire on websites associated with these Services, you may receive telemarketing calls from or on behalf of a Lender at the telephone number(s) you provide. By submitting your name, contact information and other information, your identity will no longer be anonymous. Any loan or other business conducted is between you and the Lender.
